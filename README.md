Scripts for "Discordant effects of maternal age on the human MII oocyte transcriptome"

This repository contains the scripts used to create the integrated expression atlas of human MII oocyte transcriptomes, as described in Zhang, _et al._ (2025) [Discordant effects of maternal age on the human MII oocyte transcriptome](https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaf038).

Scripts should be run in numbered order, with more specific detail on usage and prerequisites (and commands for creating figures from their output, where appropriate) available as comments within the scripts themselves.
